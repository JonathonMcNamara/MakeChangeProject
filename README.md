# MakeChangeProject

## How To Run 

	Start the program by answering the 2 prompts in the console
	If running the program from terminal, make sure to javac the file first so it has a class file

## Project Description

	This product is designed to designate a price for a products(the first prompt) followed by an amount the customer gives you 	(the second prompt)

	Following entering those 2 values in, it will output a screen of how many bills you are to receive as well as how many of 		each coin if needed. It will also have a total value at the end of it

## Technologies Used
	
	In this program, there is a method outside of the main called makeChange that performs the task of converting the difference 	of values into individual bills as well as a base conversion in the main that gives your total dollar amount
	
## Lessons Learned

	This program taught me how to really use the modulus operator. I was at first confused as to how I was going to perform
	the conversions of each and add them together but after searching online slightly, I came to really understand it
